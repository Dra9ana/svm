# SVM Classification Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on kernel-based classification, utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) with Gaussian and polynomial kernels to classify data effectively. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these kernels on a specified dataset while optimizing hyperparameters through cross-validation.

## Achievements
- Successfully implemented Gaussian and polynomial kernel functions, enabling flexible decision boundaries for classification tasks.
- Developed a robust cross-validation method to assess model performance across different hyperparameters, ensuring reliable results.
- Achieved significant insights into the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model accuracy, demonstrated through comprehensive visualizations of training and validation losses.
- Generated informative plots to illustrate the relationship between hyperparameter values and model performance, aiding in the selection of optimal parameters.

## Key Features
- **Kernel Implementations**: Includes custom implementations of both Gaussian and polynomial kernels.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Employs cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Visual representations of validation and training losses to facilitate performance analysis.
